-- 1: Find the films with less duration, show the title and rating. 

SELECT title,rating FROM film WHERE `length` <=ALL (SELECT `length` FROM film);

SELECT title FROM film WHERE 1=(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film WHERE `length`=(SELECT MIN(`length`) FROM film));
-- COUNT: Devuelve el nÃºmero de filas, incluidos duplicados, no NULL y filas

-- 3: Generate a report with list of customers showing the lowest payments done by each of them. Show customer information, the address and the lowest amount, provide both solution using ALL and/or ANY and MIN.
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name,
(SELECT MIN(amount) FROM payment p WHERE p.customer_id = c.customer_id),
(SELECT address FROM address a WHERE c.address_id = a.address_id)
FROM customer c;
-- MIN: Devuelve el minimo (valor mas bajo), MAX: El maximo (valor mas alto)

-- 4: Generate a report that shows the customer's information with the highest payment and the lowest payment in the same row.
SELECT c.customer_id,c.first_name,c.last_name,
(SELECT CONCAT (
	"Minimo: ",(SELECT MIN(amount)
		FROM payment p
		WHERE c.customer_id = p.customer_id), " Maximo: ",
	(SELECT MAX(amount)
		FROM payment p
		WHERE c.customer_id = p.customer_id)
	))AS lowest_highest_paymemt
FROM customer c; 
-- CONCAT: Nos concatena los valores, es decir los pone uno al lado del otro en una misma fila.
